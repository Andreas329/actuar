Description: Actuarial science functionalities, mostly in the
  fields of loss distributions, risk theory (including ruin theory),
  simulation of compound hierarchical models and credibility theory.
  The package also provides support functions for 19 continuous heavy
  tailed probability distributions commonly used to model insurance
  losses, and for zero-modified and zero-truncated versions of the
  discrete distributions commonly used to model loss frequency.
