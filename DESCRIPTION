Description: Functions and data sets for actuarial tasks:
  modeling of loss distributions; risk theory and ruin theory;
  simulation of compound models, discrete mixtures and compound
  hierarchical models; credibility theory. Support for 19 continuous
  heavy tailed probability distributions useful for modeling
  insurance loss amounts. Support for phase-type distributions to
  compute ruin probabilities. Support for the Poisson-inverse Gaussian
  discrete distribution and for the zero-truncated and zero-modified
  extensions of the standard discrete distributions for modeling
  loss frequency.
