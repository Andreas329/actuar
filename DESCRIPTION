Description: Numerous actuarial science functionalities for modeling of
  loss distributions; risk theory and ruin theory; simulation
  of compound models, discrete mixtures and compound hierarchical
  models; credibility theory. Support for 19 continuous heavy tailed
  probability distributions useful for insurance loss severity
  modeling. Support for phase-type distributions used in computation
  of ruin probabilities. Support for the Poisson-inverse Gaussian
  discrete distribution and for the zero-truncated and zero-modified
  extensions of the discrete distributions commonly used in loss
  frequency modeling.
